In my project on customer segmentation analysis, I focus on leveraging data mining techniques to understand and tailor marketing strategies within the insurance sector. By analyzing a dataset comprising 53,503 customer records distributed across five distinct segments, I employ various analytical models to enhance customer satisfaction and loyalty. This approach underscores the vital role of data-driven decision-making in refining product offerings and marketing strategies in a highly competitive market.
The project repository includes a PowerPoint presentation that visually encapsulates the insights and methodologies used. Decision Trees, Neural Networks, and Regression Models were evaluated, with the Regression Model identified as the most effective in capturing the complexities inherent in customer data. This methodology demonstrates how strategic segmentation can significantly improve both customer retention and acquisition, thereby optimizing the lifetime value of customers.
The insights gained highlight the necessity of continuously adapting to the evolving market conditions by regularly updating segmentation approaches. This project also addresses the complexities of managing a large dataset with diverse attributes, and the implications of financial variability among customers on segmentation robustness. The findings serve as a foundational guide for implementing targeted, data-driven marketing and product strategies in the insurance industry.
